# NotTrash

A simple, minimalist app designed to encourage local communities to reduce landfill waste by upcycling items that would otherwise be thrown out. 
After all, one person's trash can be another's treasure.

Users can create and view public posts with images and descriptions of items shared by other community members, with the option to filter by borough.
Members can then message each other to set up specifics to pass on the item to its next home.

Entirely developed and featured in a 2-day Hackathon themed around environmental change.
